## Sharding a database

* Should be able to have backups
* Data should be replicated acorss shards
* Each shard should have the same amount of data
* Shards should auto-rebalance

* How much data should we store?
* What's the rate of new data coming in?
* What can we assume about our machines?
* How many machines do we have?

201TB capacity 
so after a 100 days, every 10 days there after 
* want to keep storage utilization lower than 100%, maybe at 80%

QPS = queries per second
10M qps @ 10kb = 100,000,000kb / sec = 100gb/sec
@ 100mb/sec speed, we would need a 1000 machines

Use consistent hashing
